# Summary

### What I was able to complete:

- Made multiple endpoint to perform `CREATE`, `READ`, `DELETE` for posts
- Made an endpoint to get `USERS`
- Used MongoDB for the database, the reason I choose to use MongoDB is because I don't have a lot of experince using in-memory databases and to save on time I decided to use Mongo
