# Summary

### What I was able to complete:

- Made multiple endpoint to perform `CREATE`, `READ`, `DELETE` for posts
- Made an endpoint to get `USERS`
- Used MongoDB for the database, the reason I choose to use MongoDB is because I don't have a lot of experince using in-memory databases and to save on time I decided to use Mongo

#### What I would do next:

- Make an `UPDATE` endpoint
- Create unit test to ensure that all the endpoints are working correctly
- Deploy to Heroku
